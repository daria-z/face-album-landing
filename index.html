								<h2 class="text-block__h">FACE begins, maybe a bit surprisingly,
									with a circus-type melody on “Face-off.”</h2>
								<p class="text-block__p">
									The world of entertainment is a wild one; the experience of
									existing so
									intensely in the public eye might sometimes feel akin to
									wearing a full face of
									makeup and putting on a performance for the sake of everyone
									in the vicinity.</p>
								<p class="text-block__p">“Face-off” cascades into “Interlude :
									Dive,” an amalgam
									of sounds and memories
									both sweet and sad. The vignettes offer an intimate look into
									Jimin’s daily
									life, especially since these are noted as audio clips he chose
									and, in places,
									recorded himself — there’s a knock at the door followed by the
									sound of
									someone
									catching their breath; later, we hear a flashback to Jimin
									introducing himself
									onstage at a BTS concert. Is it a coincidence or an Easter egg
									that the chord
									progression mirrors bandmate j-hope’s “Blue Side?”</p>

								<h2 class="text-block__h">Jimin Drops Debut Solo Album ‘FACE’
								</h2>
								<p class="text-block__p">The six-track project from the K-pop
									idol was preceded by pre-release single
									“Set Me Free, Pt.2” and its dance-heavy music video directed
									by Oui Kim, and
									also contains title track “Like Crazy,” album opener
									“Face-Off” and more. In
									addition to production from the likes of Pdogg, Ghstloop and
									Evan, Jimin’s BTS
									bandmate RM also has songwriting credits on three songs on the
									tracklist.</p>
